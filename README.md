# Density-peaks-clustering-by-fast-search

Density peaks clustering by fast search is an algorithm capable of detecting clusters with complex shapes. It can identify non-spherical clusters or clusters of varying sizes, making it suitable for a variety of datasets.
We dont need to specify the number of clusters in advance.
It is also robust to noise.
Only a dataset and a dc value are needed in input.

# Analysis step and code 

At first, with the code in Python I've proposed a pyhton implementation of the density peaks clustering by fast search algorithm made by Alessandro Laio and Alex rodriguez.
Then i tested it on three different 2 dimensional datasets.
The code can be found [here](https://github.com/charlesahamed/Phishing-data-analysis/blob/main/Financial_Data_Analysis_Project_Charles_AHAMED.ipynb).
